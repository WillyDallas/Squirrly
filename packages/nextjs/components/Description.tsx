          It is common knowledge that the stronger your community, the less chance you have of being eaten alive by baby
          owls. To have a strong community, you must not only have large number, but a shared set of values and goals as
          well. Through squirrely, you will find out what your true philosophical, moral, and political values are, and
          you will meet others who share them. Through making decisions about specific thought provoking scenarios, you
          will have an absolute fucking blast just vibing on the unbounded landscape of coordinational philosophies.
